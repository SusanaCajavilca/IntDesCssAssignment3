         <h2><span class="heading">&nbsp;KitKat story&nbsp;</span> </h2>
            <p>In 1935, the first <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span>  was officially launched in UK, but with a slightly different name: 'Chocolate Crisp'. Created by the factory of Rowntree's of York, the original concept was to produce "a chocolate bar that a man could take to work in his pack up". In 1937, the name changed to the one that everybody knows: <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span>. By that time, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> was already a delicious four-piece pack bar composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> was sold first in London and throughout southern England. During World War II, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> had to change ingredients to its recipe and even change the iconic red package for a blue one. After the end of the War, things returned to normal, moreover, the business expanded. In the 1940s <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1957, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT London, created the iconic advertising line "Have a Break, Have a <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span>". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand.</p>

            </div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> through the purchase of Rowntree's, giving Nestlé global control over the brand, except in the US, where The Hershey Company has the licence to produce <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> bars in the United States which dates from 1970. Nowadays, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> bars are produced in US by The Hershey Company, and in 16 countries by Nestlé: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria, and Algeria. In 2000, Nestlé acquired the rights of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe. Throughout the decade, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets. In September 2010, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> celebrated its 75th anniversary. Nestlé stated, "Since that momentous day in 1935, <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> has firmly established itself in British culture, spreading its chocolate fingers far and wide that is sold in more countries than any other chocolate brand".</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Enjoying a pause in the hectic daily life with a delicious <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> has now a universal meaning. Everybody in the world can recognize the 'standard' <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> 4-piece chocolate finger with a wafer core. You can eat alone, or with a cup of milk. You can eat at any moment of the day: morning, afternoon, night. It can be a snack or a desert. You can eat it by yourself or in company. <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> has been present in this planet during 88 years, and there is no date for retirement so far. Other <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> forms, flavours and shapes have been successfully introduced and promoted to the always competitive candy market and never left you disappointed. <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> is the first global chocolate brand to use 100% sustainably sourced cocoa through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan and Rainforest Alliance certified. y 2025 <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> is committed to become carbon neutral – reducing our emissions as much as possible and supporting a transition to regenerative agriculture.</p>

            <h2><span class="heading">&nbsp;KitKat different flavours and presentations&nbsp;</span></h2>
            <p>Many varieties of <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as Valentine's Day. In Japan, Nestlé has introduced over different flavours including soy sauce, green tea, and sake. The <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> Dark and <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> Mint. All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> Original, the <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> White, and from 2012 the <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> Cookies & Cream.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a 'monster Size' bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered "Chunky <span class="rreedd">KitKats</span>" were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours. The market for Chunky <span class="rreedd">KitKats</span> has also expanded to Canada.Other forms and shapes include "Choc'n'Go" individually wrapped fingers in France, a twelve-finger "Family Block" available in New Zealand and Australia, round bite-sized "Pop Choc" pieces, square "Kubes", praline-filled "Senses", a yoghurt with <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> pieces, and a <span class="rreedd">KitKat</span> ice cream cone.</p>
